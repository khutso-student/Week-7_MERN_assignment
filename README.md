# 📝 Task Management System — MERN Stack 🚀

This is a **Task Management Web Application** built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their tasks with a clean dashboard UI.

# ✅ What We Achieved

This project demonstrates the successful development and deployment of a **full-stack MERN Task Management Application** with the following key achievements:

- 🔐 **Authentication System**  
  Built a secure login and signup system using **JWT**, allowing users to safely access and manage their tasks.

- 🧠 **Context-based State Management**  
  Implemented React Context API to manage user state and authentication across components.

- 📋 **Task CRUD Operations**  
  Users can **create**, **view**, and **manage** their tasks with data persisted in a MongoDB database.

- 🌍 **Full-Stack Integration**  
  Successfully connected the **frontend React app** to the **Express API** and **MongoDB database**, handling CORS and async HTTP requests smoothly.

- 🚀 **Live Deployment**  
  Deployed the backend on **Render** and frontend on **Vercel**, configured environment variables, and ensured production-ready CORS handling.

- 🧪 **Backend Testing**  
  Wrote and passed **automated tests** using Jest, Supertest, and MongoDB Memory Server to validate the API functionality.

- ⚙️ **DevOps Practices**  
  Used `.env` for environment config, `pnpm` for package management, and structured the codebase using modern best practices.
